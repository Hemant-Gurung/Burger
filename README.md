# Manaengine
This is a 2D engine made with C++. It is made with the help of professors and the resources from the book Game Programming patterns.
All the proper design patterns such as Command pattern, component pattern, observer pattern, etc  are used in the engine. 

  Proper Game-loop and Update method is the core of any Game engine. So such crital parts of the engine is implemented. 
 In this Project I have made the arcade game Tron (Tank part) using the engine.
