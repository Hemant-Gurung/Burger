This is a 2D engine developed by  Hemant Gurung with the help of DAE teachers. 
The engine to be specific has commonly known as component system, where each of thema are a gameobject.
Another thing is that this engine uses scenemanager to add different scenes and switch between them.

It is very easy to add scene and use those in this engine. Every gameobjects can be tagged to be specific and for properly identifying them.

Levels are loaded using svg file format. 

 Collisioion system is done by adding raycast to the engine.

Some of the patterns used are Observer pattern, command etc..

In summary this engine is made to easily make 2D games, which still can be improved a lot in the future.

Thank you.
